#Production Bridge

Engineering and manufacturing a new product is a big challenge. Much of the effort is spent in developing the concept into an engineered product in anticipation of mass manufacturing. But often the investment in production tooling for process like injection molding is a significant financial barrier and time delay.   How does the engineering team move forward?

A+J has worked with many clients who want to 'bridge' the gap between a prototype and a manufactured product. This 'beta run' provides production parts and assemblies without investing in expensive tooling for processes like injection molding, RIM, or pressure forming. This bridge can also fill in the gap caused by the ramp up time required for larger production methods. 

We have built a specialty in production bridge solutions for new products. Our high quality parts can be produced in low qualities  (1-300 units)  for companies in the tech and medtech fields. We are flexible enough to take on small numbers but precise enough meet high quality standards. This enables our clients to quickly get their product to market without the delays or costs of traditional production processes. Combined with our finishing and light assembly services, we can become a single source for your initial runs of completed products.

Handle job from a to z, no subbing out (master patterns, molds, casting, painting, assembly, packaging)
Medical enclosures.
Materials UL Certified, Rohas compliant. Plus UL Cert Shielding.

Bring your ideas by the facility, or give us a call, so we can discuss how a production bridge can give your product schedule a boost.
