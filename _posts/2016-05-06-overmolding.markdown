#Overmolding: The intricate process


You've used overloaded products. That soft grip handle on your drill or toothbrush was overmolded. Whether it's an alternate color, texture or flexibility, many of today's plastic products use overmolding.

By definition, overmolding is the process of molding one material, usually a flexible plastic, onto a second material, often a rigid plastic. Overmolding can be used to enhance a product's safety, ergonomics, functionality, and/or appearance. The options are endless.
