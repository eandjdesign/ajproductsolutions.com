  <ul class="history-nav">
    <li class="history-step" data-year="1998">In 1998, Art Villa, an aspiring entrepreneur, saw a need to provide quality soft tooling (RTV molding) and cast urethane parts. Starting as a moonlight business, Art enlisted the help of his trusted friends and coworkers to help fulfill his orders right out of his garage! They made cast urethane prototyping models for local prototyping shops and design studios. As their reputation grew, so did their facility needs.</li>
    <li class="history-step" data-year="2001">In 2001 A+J Product Solutions was born as Art made a commitment to establish his own production prototype service and moved his operation to a light-industrial complex in Sunnyvale, California (his neighbors cheered!). Two years later, Art added CNC machining capability and moved again to a larger 3,500 SF facility. This expansion allowed A + J to add low-volume manufacturing, certified EMI shielding and value-added light assembly to its service offerings.</li>
    <li class="history-step" data-year="2005">In 2005, Art responded to his clients need to accommodate large-sized part machining by purchasing his second CNC machine.</li>
    <li class="history-step" data-year="2006">In 2006, A+J acquired a new 12,000 sq. ft. facility which included 6 Haas CNC machines. The new machines brought the total to 8 and the square footage greatly expanded the capability of our machining and molding/casting departments. The new facility has enabled our talented staff to make A+J a one-stop, full-service operation.</li>
    <li class="history-step" data-year="2013">In 2013 A&amp;J teamed up with Prototypes Plus to add SLA and SLS Services to its offerings. Stereothography opens new doors for its clients.</li>
    <li class="history-step" data-year="2015">In 2015 A&amp;J purchased the building and remodeled the exterior to better represent the vibrant business inside.</li>
    <li class="history-step" data-year="Today">Today you tell us about your idea.</li>
